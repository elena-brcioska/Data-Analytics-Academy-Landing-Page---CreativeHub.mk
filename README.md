<h1>Landing Page for Data Analytics Academy @ CreativeHub - Educational Company</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I had the opportunity to develop the Landing Page for the Data Analytics at CreativeHub.
<br />
For this website I worked back to back with a Ux Ui Designer, and developed the project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like Bootstrap, AOS Library, and GlideJs.
<br />
The webpage is made responsive for all viewports
